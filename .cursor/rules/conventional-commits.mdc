# Conventional Commits Specification

Follow the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) for all commit messages.

## Commit Message Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

### Primary Types
- **feat**: New feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer)
- **fix**: Bug fix (correlates with PATCH in SemVer)

### Additional Types
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Breaking Changes

Indicate breaking changes using:
1. `!` after type/scope: `feat!: breaking change`
2. `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## Examples

## Guidelines

2. Keep description under 72 characters
3. Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
4. Don't capitalize first letter of description
5. Don't end description with a period
6. Use scope to indicate which part of the codebase is affected
